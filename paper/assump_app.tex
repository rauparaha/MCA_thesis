\chapter[Concavity proof]{Concavity of the monopolist's profit function}
\label{cha:Assumpproof}

For concavity of the profit function we require $\ddel{\pi}{(p^t)} <
0$. Now, by differentiating equation \eqref{dur:profit} twice
\begin{equation}
    \ddel{\pi}{(p^t)} = 2 \del{x}{p^t}  - \del{x}{p^t} C''(x) + \ddel{x}{(p^t)} \bigl( p - C'(x)
    \bigr) < 0
\end{equation}
The term $2 \del{x}{p^t}$ is negative because of the downward slope
of the demand function and $- \del{x}{p^t} C''(x)$ must also be
negative since by Assumption \ref{dur:ass2} the cost function is
convex. Now a monopoly will always set $P > MC$ so $p - C'(x)$ must
be positive. Hence, it is sufficient for concavity of the profit
function that the demand function be weakly concave:
$\ddel{x}{(p^t)} \leq 0$.

Note that while this condition is sufficient it is not necessary
since if the cost function were highly convex then a mildly convex
demand function could still give a concave profit function.

Taking the second derivative of the demand function (equation
\eqref{eq:demand}) gives
\begin{equation}
    \ddel{x}{(p^t)} = \beta^2 \Phi''(p^{t-1} - \beta p^t) -
    \Phi''(p^t - \beta p^{t+1}) < 0.
\end{equation}
Hence, the condition for concavity of the demand function is
\begin{equation}    \label{dur:demandconcavity}
    \beta^2 \Phi''(p^{t-1} - \beta p^t) < \Phi''(p^t - \beta
    p^{t+1}).
\end{equation}
Now, by equation \eqref{eq:6}, $p^{t-1} - \beta p^t > p^t - \beta
p^{t+1}$ so \eqref{dur:demandconcavity} can only hold for all
possible price trajectories if $\Phi''' \leq 0$. However, if $\Phi''
< 0$ then condition \eqref{dur:demandconcavity} still cannot be
guaranteed to hold. Hence it is necessary to further assume that
$\Phi'' \geq 0$. Again, this is a sufficient rather than a necessary
condition for concavity of the profit function.
