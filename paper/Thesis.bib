	it is costly to form autonomous units, each firm does so in equilibrium,

	to the case where firms cannot form competing units. With linear
	demand and costs, duopolists choose the socially optimal number of

	accumulates over time. In our model, firms play dynamic Cournot games
	among themselves, and the government designs a tax rule that corrects
	for both the externality associated with emissions and the market
	power of oligopolists. We show that there exists a time-independent
	tax rule that guides the oligopolists to achieve the socially optimum
	production path. The optimal tax per unit of output is dependent
	on the current level of pollution stock, and it may be negative (implying
	a subsidy) when the pollution stock is low. We obtain a rather surprising
	result: in some cases, the optimal tax rule gives firms a subsidy
	for an initial time interval even though under laissez-faire their
	output exceeds the socially optimal output at each point of time.
	This subsidy, howerver, induces firms to produce less than they would
	under laissez-faire, because they know that if they produce more
